*This* exercise gives an implementation of a perceptron.

Perceptron
- A perceptron has only input layers and output layers.
- No hidden layers.
- It uses step function as activation function.
- Perceptron output is +1 or -1. -
 Perceptron Learning rule is used to update the weights and bias.

**Methodology**:

The general methodology to build a Neural Network is to:
    1. Define the neural network structure ( # of input units,  # of hidden units, etc).
    2. Initialize the model's parameters
    3. Loop:
        - Implement forward propagation
        - Compute loss
        - Update parameters (Perceptron Learning rule)
